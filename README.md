Warning: This is an experimental project that shouldnâ€™t be used in production.

## Article
I wrote an article about this [on Medium](https://medium.com/macoclock/test-your-app-on-different-screen-sizes-without-the-simulator-ce1ebfdfac22?source=friends_link&sk=db88b92c6cbb4bc1675da8e7d3cb54f6)!

Also, for an easier-to-understand but simpler version, check out [ProjectorExample](https://github.com/aheze/ProjectorExample) (which follows along the Medium article linked above)!

## Installation
Drag [Source](https://github.com/aheze/Projector/tree/master/Projector/Source) into your project.

## How To Use
Inside SceneDelegate.swift, display the root window using Projector.

```Swift
class SceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {
        // Use this method to optionally configure and attach the UIWindow `window` to the provided UIWindowScene `scene`.
        // If using a storyboard, the `window` property will automatically be initialized and attached to the scene.
        // This delegate does not imply the connecting scene or session are new (see `application:configurationForConnectingSceneSession` instead).
        guard let _ = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }
        
        /// ADD THIS
        projectorActivated = true
        
        if let rootWindow = self.window {
            let settings = ProjectorSettings()
            
            /// if true, the view will stop at the status bar's edge. If false, the view will go under the status bar.
            settings.shouldStopAtStatusBar = true
            
            /// for devices that are skinnier than the physical one, options are .left, .centered, ,right.
            /// for devices that are wider than the physical one, options are .top, .centered, ,bottom.
            settings.position = .right 
            
            /// device to project
            settings.defaultDeviceToProject = .iPhoneX
            
            /// show controls to have an on-screen control panel (allow to edit settings.position and settings.defaultDeviceToProject )
            settings.shouldShowControls = false
            
            Projector.display(rootWindow: rootWindow, settings: settings)
        }
        
    }
...
